# facial-recognition

# Working
When the AttendanceProject.py is run after installing the dependencies in requirements.txt, it accesses the camera to detect faces.
If the face matches with the faces in ImagesAttendance directory, then it records the persons attendence in Attendance.csv file.

# How it benefits?
An organization or institution using this product will be able to update attendance records of attendees, and ensures efficient management without manual intervention.
All that the attendees have to do is stand for a second in front of the camera and the attendance will be automatically registered.
